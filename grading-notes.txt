The following requirements were not met:
- Have well commented source code.
- Place the actual command run using the !num command (e.g. “./siesta &”) in
  thie history queue, rather than a literal “!num”.
- Have a correct implementation of the built-in cd command that changes the
  current working directory.

Grading Notes:
- Missing comments in history_queue.c and .h files.
- !num shows up as !num in history (not original command)
- cd /home/sat/public doesn't work
- cd public didn't work (when I was in /home/sat)
- should not use both signal and sigaction functions...
